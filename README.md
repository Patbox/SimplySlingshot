Simply Slingshot is a [Polymer](https://modrinth.com/mod/polymer)-powered Fabric Server Side modification adding Slingshot
and connected to it enchantments to the game!

Slingshot is a weapon, that can be used to shoot any kind of item. While it prioritizes items
in your hand, it can take any one of them that's currently on your hotbar.

In most cases it's damage output and range will be limited, through select items might give you
some special effects that, that might make it more useful. For example mining tools will break blocks,
Blaze Rods will ignite a fire and so on.

For it's full potential, it can be enchanted improving what can be done with it. It can be enchanted with:
- Block Placer - Makes block items shoot with it place automatically,
- Boomerang - Items that missed an entity or didn't get used up will return to you,
- Bounce - Makes all projectiles bounce of blocks. Each level allows for single bounce, with max being 5,
- Item Sender - Prevents any item effects and entity damage, but makes the item fly further.
- Tool User - Makes some tools (like axes and shovels) apply their actions on blocks and entities.
- Trajectory Prediction - Shows the potential path of the projectile.
- Quick Charge - Same as Crossbows, lowers time required to load it,
